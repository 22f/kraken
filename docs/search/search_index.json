As such, it lets you develop, debug, execute and analyze load tests . Kraken heavily relies on Docker . For its own architecture but also to run load testing tools. Currently, the only integrated load testing engine is Gatling , but Kraken is able to run any application that can fit in one (or several) Docker containers. Kraken also includes InfluxDB and Grafana to store and display test results. Downloading and Installation \u00b6 Kraken can be downloaded from our download page and installed on Linux or Windows thanks to Vagrant. Features Summary \u00b6 Once installed, Kraken comes with two frontend applications: The Gatling UI , to import, debug and run Gatling scripts, The Administration UI , to edit configuration files, run Docker containers and manage images. Gatling \u00b6 Kraken supports Gatling's script import, debug and execution: Import files : Gatling scripts (.scala) and resource files (CSV, body contents, etc.). Import HAR : Import HTTP Archives using Gatling Recorder. Debug scripts : Run Gatling's scripts with one current user only, list all request/response couples and compare them with HAR Import or previous executions. Scripts edition : Edit Gatling's scripts directly in your web browser, benefit from inline help, autocomplete and syntactic coloration. Scripts edition : Quickly run load tests thanks to custom Docker images. Analysis : Have a look at Gatling's HTML test reports in one click or display and edit automatically generated Grafana's dashboards. Administration \u00b6 Kraken's administration UI is a generic file editor / docker manager. Files tree : Upload, download, delete and edit any file managed by Kraken. Shell commands : Execute any shell command on the Docker host. Docker containers : Run, stop, display logs for all Docker containers present on the host machine. Docker images : List, pull, remove and purge all Docker images. Docker-compose : Quickly run docker-compose up/down commands for any docker-compose.yml file.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#what-is-kraken-by-octoperf","text":"Kraken by OctoPerf a load testing IDE .
